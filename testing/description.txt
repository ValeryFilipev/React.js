1. If you want to check your whole project, you can run these steps:
  1.1 $ npm install eslint --save-dev -> will set-up the package, if it's needed
  1.2 $ npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
  1.3 Create a file .eslintrc and add it to the root of app.

2. Example of the .eslintrc file

  {
     "extends": "airbnb",
     "rules": {
       "indent": [2, "tab", { "SwitchCase": 1, "VariableDeclarator": 1 }],
       "react/prop-types": 0,
       "react/jsx-indent-props": [2, "tab"]
     }
   }

  It can be changed and expands to the necessary size.(According to rules - Check on the Google)

3. Via the combination Alt + Enter - you can solve the problem (if it is possible and ESLint allow you
    to do that)

4. And you can read more info about this. But remember that ideal code won't be in reality.
   Resolve your code correctly, wisely and in measure.
